# kubernetes-configs

Public repo for some of my Kubernetes configurations.  Will update as I remember.  

Chances are, you'll have to make changes to these configs to make them work for your environment.  I am providing this configs as-is.  

My Kubernetes environment is a 3-node cluster, deployed with [RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine)](https://github.com/rancher/rke), with Ceph deployed on bare-metal.  I'm also using [MetalLB](https://github.com/google/metallb) for load balancing.
